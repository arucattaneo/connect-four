# Connect Four
A normal Connect Four game with a twist. The standard game is a two-player board game, in which each player has a character as a token and then take turns dropping them into a board (matrix). The tokens fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 

## Special features:
**There are 3 types of tokens: standard, hope and reverse**
- Standard: pretty self explanatory.
- Hope: gives the user an extra turn, but cannot play two hope tokens in a row.
- Reverse: reverts a token to the other player's character. Eg.: if player 'x' plays a reverse token on top of an 'o' that token will be replaced for an 'x'.

## The user can customize:
- The board size: 8x8, 15x15 or 20x20.
- The probability of getting a special token in each turn.
- The number of tokens that must be aligned to win.
